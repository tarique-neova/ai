ubuntu:latest (ubuntu 24.04),CVE-2016-2781,coreutils,9.4-3ubuntu6,,LOW,"chroot in GNU coreutils, when used with --userspec, allows local users to escape to the parent session via a crafted TIOCSTI ioctl call, which pushes characters to the terminal's input buffer."
ubuntu:latest (ubuntu 24.04),CVE-2022-3219,gpgv,2.4.4-2ubuntu17,,LOW,"GnuPG can be made to spin on a relatively small input by (for example) crafting a public key with thousands of signatures attached, compressed down to just a few KB."
ubuntu:latest (ubuntu 24.04),CVE-2016-20013,libc-bin,2.39-0ubuntu8.1,,LOW,sha256crypt and sha512crypt through 0.6 allow attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) because the algorithm's runtime is proportional to the square of the length of the password.
ubuntu:latest (ubuntu 24.04),CVE-2016-20013,libc6,2.39-0ubuntu8.1,,LOW,sha256crypt and sha512crypt through 0.6 allow attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) because the algorithm's runtime is proportional to the square of the length of the password.
ubuntu:latest (ubuntu 24.04),CVE-2024-2236,libgcrypt20,1.10.3-2build1,,MEDIUM,"A timing-based side-channel flaw was found in libgcrypt's RSA implementation. This issue may allow a remote attacker to initiate a Bleichenbacher-style attack, which can lead to the decryption of RSA ciphertexts."
ubuntu:latest (ubuntu 24.04),CVE-2020-22916,liblzma5,5.6.1+really5.4.5-1,,MEDIUM,"An issue discovered in XZ 5.2.5 allows attackers to cause a denial of service via decompression of a crafted file. NOTE: the vendor disputes the claims of ""endless output"" and ""denial of service"" because decompression of the 17,486 bytes always results in 114,881,179 bytes, which is often a reasonable size increase."
ubuntu:latest (ubuntu 24.04),CVE-2024-2511,libssl3t64,3.0.13-0ubuntu3,,LOW,"Issue summary: Some non-default TLS server configurations can cause unbounded
memory growth when processing TLSv1.3 sessions

Impact summary: An attacker may exploit certain server configurations to trigger
unbounded memory growth that would lead to a Denial of Service

This problem can occur in TLSv1.3 if the non-default SSL_OP_NO_TICKET option is
being used (but not if early_data support is also configured and the default
anti-replay protection is in use). In this case, under certain conditions, the
session cache can get into an incorrect state and it will fail to flush properly
as it fills. The session cache will continue to grow in an unbounded manner. A
malicious client could deliberately create the scenario for this failure to
force a Denial of Service. It may also happen by accident in normal operation.

This issue only affects TLS servers supporting TLSv1.3. It does not affect TLS
clients.

The FIPS modules in 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue. OpenSSL
1.0.2 is also not affected by this issue."
ubuntu:latest (ubuntu 24.04),CVE-2024-4603,libssl3t64,3.0.13-0ubuntu3,,LOW,"Issue summary: Checking excessively long DSA keys or parameters may be very
slow.

Impact summary: Applications that use the functions EVP_PKEY_param_check()
or EVP_PKEY_public_check() to check a DSA public key or DSA parameters may
experience long delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked
have been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of
Service.

The functions EVP_PKEY_param_check() or EVP_PKEY_public_check() perform
various checks on DSA parameters. Some of those computations take a long time
if the modulus (`p` parameter) is too large.

Trying to use a very large modulus is slow and OpenSSL will not allow using
public keys with a modulus which is over 10,000 bits in length for signature
verification. However the key and parameter check functions do not limit
the modulus size when performing the checks.

An application that calls EVP_PKEY_param_check() or EVP_PKEY_public_check()
and supplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could be
vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.

These functions are not called by OpenSSL itself on untrusted DSA keys so
only applications that directly call these functions may be vulnerable.

Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL pkey and pkeyparam command line applications
when using the `-check` option.

The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.

The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are affected by this issue."
ubuntu:latest (ubuntu 24.04),CVE-2024-4741,libssl3t64,3.0.13-0ubuntu3,,LOW,A use-after-free vulnerability was found in OpenSSL. Calling the OpenSSL API SSL_free_buffers function may cause memory to be accessed that was previously freed in some situations.
